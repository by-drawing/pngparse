pngparse
========

This is a little pure-JavaScript module for Node.JS that I made because I
wanted to be able to read PNG images in Node, and I can't get various other
modules to compile on all the different operating systems that I use.

It is very immature and very incomplete. I only plan to extend it as much as
needed to accomplish my own goals; however, I will gladly accept push requests
that contribute meaningfully. Please make sure anything you write is tested,
though.
